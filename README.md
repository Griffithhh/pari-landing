I would like to describe the functionality of my website. In the Leaderboard component, there is a list of players that I gather from a JSON object, displaying each round with different results. This is managed by clicking on a button, which can also be active or inactive, utilizing the Math.floor function. Additionally, I have implemented checkboxes that show relevant information.
