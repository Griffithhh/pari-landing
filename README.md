Hello, this is landing page from React
I am sending you the project. I managed to adapt it for mobile phones. There are some moments where, in a hurry, I used SVG elements in Figma. I used useEffect for the loading icon and useState for button activation. I also have a small data set with objects to display each winner on the page. If you give me a little more time, I will definitely finish it. Anyway, thank you for such a great opportunity to try my hand at landing page development; it was very interesting to use Figma. Before this, I wrote styles manually, which made them more adaptable to resolution changes. I also had some trouble downloading some images from Figma â€“ for example, the highlight images for the motorcycle.
